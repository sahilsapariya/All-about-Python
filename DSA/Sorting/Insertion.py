"""
    Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm 
    that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.

    The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.

    The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.

    Characteristics of Insertion Sort:
        â†’ This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation
        â†’ Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
        â†’ Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, 
          i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.
